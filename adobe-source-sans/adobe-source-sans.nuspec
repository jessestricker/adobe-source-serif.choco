    <summary>Sans serif font family for user interface environments.</summary>
    <description>Source Sans was designed by Paul D. Hunt under the guidance of Robert Slimbach. It was Adobeâ€™s first open source typeface family, conceived primarily as a typeface for user interfaces. Source Sans draws inspiration from the clarity and legibility of twentieth-century American gothic typeface designs. Distilling the best archetypical qualities of these models, Paul followed a rational design approach by simplifying glyph shapes by paring them to their essential form. However, in order to more easily differentiate similar letter shapes (such as uppercase I and lowercase L), some additional details have been added. Besides providing such explicitly clarity in short text strings, another fundamental design consideration was to create a typeface that reads well in extended settings. This can be seen in the general proportions: Source Sans has been designed with a more generous width than many other comparable gothics, and its shorter majuscule letters, combined with minuscule letters with longer extenders, create a more pleasant reading texture in longer text passages.

This package installs the `.ttf` files in the variable variant.</description>
